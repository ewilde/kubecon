# Intro
* Story about 2 systems, 1 group of engineers

System 1
* Looks at how we evolved unreliable inter-service communication
 * Increased reliability
 * Reduced overall latency
 * But did not manage to reduce tail-latency
 
System 2
 * Increased reliability
 * Reduced overall latency
 * Reduced tail-latency somewhat - still more to do here
